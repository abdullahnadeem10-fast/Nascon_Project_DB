# NASCON Project

This project was developed for NASCON — a platform designed to put both SQL and Web Development skills to the test. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of designing, developing, and integrating a dynamic, database-powered application.

## Project Manifesto

NASCON stands for National Software Convention — a flagship event where innovation, coding prowess, and technical creativity come together. This project was an opportunity to showcase my ability to connect a relational database (MySQL) with a full stack application (Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The application aims to provide a seamless, interactive, and data-centric experience for users, reflecting real-world scenarios and business logic.

## Tech Stack

- Database: MySQL  
- Back-end: Node.js with Express  
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Other: API routing, CRUD operations, and form submission with data persistence  

## Features

- Perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the MySQL database  
- User-friendly web-interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Seamless API endpoints powered by Node.js  
- Proper error handling and validation for robustness  
- Database schema designed following normalization principles  

## Installation & Run

To get up and running with the project:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nascon-project.git
cd nascon-project

2. Installing dependencies:

npm install

3. Set up your MySQL database:

- Create a new database (say `nascon`) in MySQL.  
- Import the provided `nascon.sql` script to create tables.

  ```
  SOURCE nascon.sql;
  ```

4. Edit your `config/database.js` with your credentials:

```js
const connection = mysql.createConnection({ 
    host: "your-database-ip-or-name",
    user: "your-username",
    password: "your-password",
    database: "nascon"
});

5. Start the application:
node server.js

6. Open your browser at:

http://localhost:3000

Additional Notes

This project is meant for educational purposes, demonstrating a standard stack (MySQL, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Feel free to modify, reuse, or adapt the code for your own portfolio or practice.
